# SQL Techniques - Basics to Advanced

Hello! This repository is my personal SQL reference - a living collection of notes, examples, and use cases that cover everything from fundamentals to advanced techniques. I built this repo to document what I learn, forget, update, and relearn. So it's both a refresher and a roadmap for continuous improvement.

# Structure
The content is organized into three main sections:

## 1. Basics - Foundations of SQL
Core syntax, data retrieval, and fundamental operations that every analyst must master. 

**Includes**:
- `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`
- Filtering with `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`
- Sorting and limited results with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Basic aggregations: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`
- Subqueries

## 2. Intermediate - Problem Solving
Powering reports, pipelines or dashboards. 

**Includes**:
- Common Table Expressions (`CTE`) and temporary tables
- Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`
- Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`
- Complex joins and union operations
- Date and time functions
- Performance tuning basics (indexes, query plans)
- Data cleaning and transformation with SQL

## 3. Advanced - Analytical and Engineering Patterns
For complex datasets, analytics engineering, and data science pipelines

**Includes**:
- Recursive CTEs
- Advanced window functions
- Query optimization and benchmarking
- Using SQL for data validation and QA
- SQL in ETL design and data modeling
- Analytical problem-solving patterns (e.g., cohort analysis, funnel conversion tracking)
